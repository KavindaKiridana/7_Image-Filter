# ðŸš€ Image Filtering Application

## ðŸ“‚ ***About this program***

A Python script that automates the process of organizing and filtering image files from your computer.

## ðŸ“‚ Features

### Image Organization

- Automatically collects and organizes image files (jpg, jpeg, png, gif, bmp, webp, heic) from a source folder
- Creates a new folder with a random number (e.g., "imageFilter1234") to avoid overwriting existing folders
- Filters out small images by only copying files larger than 9,999 bytes (removes thumbnails/icons)

### File Cleanup

You can choose to either keep or delete the original files after copying. This is useful when you want to:

- Clean up a messy folder while preserving important images
- Extract images from a folder containing mixed file types
- Create a backup of just your images

## ðŸ“‚ Common Use Cases

### Photo Management

- Extracting photos from a downloads folder
- Organizing images scattered across different folders
- Creating an image-only backup

### Data Organization

- Separating images from documents and other files
- Creating a clean collection of images for a project
- Filtering out small/unwanted images while keeping full-size photos

### Storage Cleanup

- Moving images to a different drive
- Creating organized archives of images
- Removing duplicate images from the source location if desired

## ðŸ“‚ ***Instructions to run this program***

## ðŸ“‚ Requirements

- Python installed on your computer
